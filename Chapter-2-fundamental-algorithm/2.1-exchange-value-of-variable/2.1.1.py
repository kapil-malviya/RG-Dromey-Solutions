To exchange the drinks of two glasses, Glass A (raspberry drink) and Glass B (lemonade), we can use temporary glass (Glass C). Here's how we can do it step by step :

1. Get an empty glass C (temporary glass)
2. Pour drink of glass A(raspberry drink) into glass C
3. Now glass A is empty and glass C contains raspberry drink
4. Now pour drink of glass B(lemonade) into glass A
5. Now glass A contains lemonade and glass B is empty
6. At last pour the drink of glass C(raspberry) into glass B

Finally exchange is complete, glass A has lemonade and glass B has raspberry drink.
